# FPRaycaster
Simple first person raycaster written in C++ using olcPixelGameEngine.

## Notes
Assets are not supplied, rather, you must supply them yourself. Check `Raytracer.cpp` for details on what you need to include.

## Attributions
This project is based on the olcPixelGameEngine by javidx9 (aka OneLoneCoder on GitHub). You should be able to switch out the .h file to the newest version, however there is one patch that is optional which will hide the mouse cursor.

## Screenshots
